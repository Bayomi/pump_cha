## 9 Yards Project


### Description

A competition which targets the prediction of possible faults in Tanzania water pumps. Weâ€™ve been using this specific goal to study the diverse pre-processing techniques for missing and unreliable data and the combinations of different models to rise our accuracy. We used different techniques and frameworks (sklearn, TensorFlow). The final results will be posted after January.
